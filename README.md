This repository showcases three industry-based robot simulation projects developed in CoppeliaSim. The projects include an Industrial Robot performing assembly tasks, a Disaster Response Robot navigating challenging environments and detecting potential threats, and a Military Robot (UNDERDOG) designed to disable or destroy enemy tanks. Each simulation features realistic 3D environments, customizable robot designs, and industry-specific scenarios and tasks. These projects have potential applications in research, education, and training. To get started, clone the repository, install CoppeliaSim, and run the simulations to explore the scenarios. The projects are organized in separate folders for easy access. This repository is licensed under [insert license] and was developed and shared by ME.
